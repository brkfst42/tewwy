<h3>What is the relationship between depression symptoms and perceived stress?</h3>
<p>Roughly 1,500 individuals who used TEWWY’s services between June and October 2021 completed two surveys, the PHQ-9 Questionnaire which measures depression symptom severity and a survey adapted from the Perceived Stress Scale. There is a moderate, positive linear correlation between the two scores (r=0.51).</p>
<p>However, it is also interesting to note the individuals who may be highly stressed, but do not show depression symptoms, or those who may show some depression symptoms, but do not feel stressed. TEWWY’s psychosocial interventions are individualized to serve the needs of each individual client. <strong>(Click or hover over the scatterplot in Chart C to see individual client details.)</strong></p>
<p>Clients were also asked if they would be interested to attend group therapy; 40% said Yes and 60% said No. </p>

**Tap Elderly Women's Wisdom for Youth (TEWWY)** provides psychosocial interventions and mental health services to support communities and individuals. 

**Located in Dar es Salaam, the largest city of Tanzania and the fifth largest city in Africa**, TEWWY offers the modern interpretation of intergenerational fireside chats, during which the elders would impart wisdom to young people.

### Age and Gender Distribution of TEWWY Clients

In June to October 2021, TEWWY provided mental health interventions to individuals ranging from age 11 to 88, with an average age of 36.3. In Tanzania, the average age of the population is 18. There may be potential for TEWWY to develop more programs to serve those under 18 years old.

### TEWWY reaches male and female members of the community

Notably, TEWWY serves men and women in roughly equal numbers. This is in contrast to many nonprofit mental health organizations around the world, which face difficulties reaching men. It is possible that, as TEWWY's counselors are elderly women playing a grandmotherly role and TEWWY's psychosocial interventions are developed from intergenerational fireside chats, men feel comfortable with this approach.

### What is the relationship between depression symptoms and perceived stress? 

Roughly 1,500 individuals who used TEWWY's services between June and October 2021 completed two surveys, the PHQ-9 Questionnaire which measures depression symptom severity and a survey adapted from the Perceived Stress Scale. There is a moderate, positive linear correlation between the two scores (r=0.51). 

However, it is also interesting to note the individuals who may be highly stressed, but do not show depression symptoms, or those who may show some depression symptoms, but do not feel stressed. TEWWY's psychosocial interventions are individualized to serve the needs of each individual client. **(Click or hover over the scatterplot in Chart C to see individual client details.)**

Clients were also asked if they would be interested to attend group therapy; 40% said Yes and 60% said No.
